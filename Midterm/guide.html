            <b>CPU and RAM Install: </b> After unpacking the mother board, locate the CPU socket and undo the clamp.
            Carefully put the the CPU into the socket, lining up the corners with the proper labels and clamp it down.
            Then move over to the RAM slots and unlatch the appropriate slot. Push in RAM until it clicks. Assuming
            everything seems snug and in place then this step was completed successfully.

            <b>CPU Cooler Install: </b> Unpack the CPU cooler and set it aside. After completing the CPU and RAM install
            get the motherboard and install the mounting bracket for the cooler around the CPU socket. Apply a small dot
            of thermal paste to the top of the CPU. Once the bracket is installed screw down the cooler onto the CPU.
            Then plug the fan cable into the motherboard port labeled "cpu". The cooler is now installed.

            <b>GPU Install: </b> Unpack the graphics card and put the computer on its side. Unscrew the side ports so
            the card will fit in the computer. Insert the graphics card into the PCI-E slot in the motherboard. Once
            the graphics card is lined up with the side of the case, screw it into the case. Some cards will require
            extra power so make sure to connect that if needed.
